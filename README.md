Welcome
=======

sandbox that collects code snippets from bug tickets and ffmpeg/libav forum entries which tries to encode a given volume with h264 and h265. As I am so glad, that the code seems to work, I am lacking documentation. Feel free to ask any question through the issue tracker, upon which I might add documentation.
